# Movie Ratings Analysis

## **Overview**

In this assignment, you will leverage Spark Structured APIs to analyze a dataset containing movie ratings and streaming data. The goal is to extract insights into binge-watching behavior, user churn risk, and trends in movie watching across years. Using the power of Spark, you will perform data transformations, aggregations, and generate insights to help understand movie consumption patterns.

## **Objectives**

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**: Import and preprocess movie ratings data using Spark Structured APIs.
2. **Data Analysis**: Perform complex queries to identify patterns in binge-watching behavior and churn risks.
3. **Insight Generation**: Derive actionable insights from movie consumption trends across different years.

## **Assignment Tasks**

You are required to complete the following three analysis tasks using Spark Structured APIs. Ensure that your analysis is well-documented, with clear explanations and any relevant visualizations or summaries.

### **1. Identify Departments with High Satisfaction and Engagement**

**Objective:**

Determine which movies have an average watch time greater than 100 minutes and rank them based on user engagement.

**Tasks:**

- **Filter Movies**: Select movies that have been watched for more than 100 minutes on average.
- **Analyze Average Watch Time**: Compute the average watch time per user for each movie.
- **Identify Top Movies**: List movies where the average watch time is among the highest.


**Expected Outcome:**

A list of departments meeting the specified criteria, along with the corresponding percentages.

**Example Output:**

| Age Group   | Binge Watchers | Percentage |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Teen        | 195            | 45%        |
| Adult       | 145            | 38%        |

### **2. Identify Churn Risk Users**  

**Objective:**  

Find users who are **at risk of churn** by identifying those with **canceled subscriptions and low watch time (<100 minutes)**.

**Tasks:**  

- **Filter Users**: Select users who have `SubscriptionStatus = 'Canceled'`.  
- **Analyze Watch Time**: Identify users with `WatchTime < 100` minutes.  
- **Count At-Risk Users**: Compute the total number of such users.  

**Expected Outcome:**  

A count of users who **canceled their subscriptions and had low engagement**, highlighting **potential churn risks**.

**Example Output:**  


|Churn Risk Users                                  |	Total Users |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
|Users with low watch time & canceled subscriptions|	350         |
